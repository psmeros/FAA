Dr Roland Fumasi	unknown	PERSON	fruit	0.909759459	fruit	0.8616071439645	"While weÂ’ve seen minimal change in global consumption of food categories such as cereals, pulses and oilcrops over this period, the fruit and vegetable category has flourished with global consumption rising from approximately 175 kg per capita per year in the early 1990s to well over 250kg per capita per year in recent years.Â”Â“This trend of increased fruit and vegetable consumption in developing countries is expected to continue over the coming decade and over this period we also expect to see the percentage of the global middle-classes based in the Asia-Pacific region to climb higher and higher,Â” he said.Â“This is obviously a big plus for New Zealand given its proximity to markets in this region.Â”While there was great potential to increase fruit and vegetable exports into developing countries, Dr Fumasi said that New ZealandÂ’s global reputation as a supplier of top quality produce meant it should also be looking to target increased exports into developed markets in countries such as the US, Japan, Australia, the EU and Canada where consumers could pay premium prices.Â“Fresh produce from New Zealand is very highly regarded not only in the US, but around the globe."	Dr Fumasi	unknown	PERSON	fruit	0.909759459	fruit	0.75781259646	"New Zealand also stacks up really well in the fruit and vegetable export arena due to factors such as the strong industry organisation present here, New ZealandÂ’s ability to supply counter-seasonal produce, and the ease of doing business with Kiwi companies,Â” he said.Â“There are some limitations to New ZealandÂ’s export capability, such as the relatively limited availability of land and of labour, and this does reduce the ability to increase fruit and vegetable production levels, however, these limitations emphasise the need to focus on maximizing the value of what is produced here.Â”In order to gain a greater share of the fruit and vegetable space in developed markets, Dr Fumasi said New Zealand would need to closely follow consumption trends apparent in developed countries.Â“In developed countries weÂ’re not seeing increased consumption of fruit and vegetables, but we are seeing a change towards more expensive and exotic fruit and vegetables.Â”Â“In these markets, consumers not only want their fruit and vegetables to be convenient, to be healthy, to look good and to taste good all year round, they also want them be safe, to be responsibly produced and they want to know where they came from,Â” he said.Â“I call this consumer expectation Â“100 per cent perfect Â– all the timeÂ” and itÂ’s really changed the definition of quality, with each individual consumerÂ’s values playing a significant role in the perception of quality to them.Â”Dr Fumasi said that while these trends were mainly evident in developed markets, they were becoming more prominent in developing markets as well.Dr Fumasi said the New Zealand fruit and vegetable industry would need to preserve its brand equity and continue investment in the sector to maximise the returns from exported produce.Â“The industry here will need to ensure that it maintains its reputation as a grower of top quality, safe, sustainably-produced produce as well as continuing to invest in R&D that progresses technologies and growing systems to deliver produce which meets the requirements of todayÂ’s consumers,Â” he said.. ."

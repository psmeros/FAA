       "3   Obesity is a global epidemic. The World Health Organization now places it as the world's leading non-communicable disease, ahead of even diabetes or cancer. And Americans are more obese than most.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, people believe that either genetics--if your mom or dad was obese, then you're likely to be as well--or personal choices are to blame. Most obesity researchers--and most diets--focus nearly exclusively on the individual and the daily food choices each of us makes.\\n\\nNew, fad diets or efforts to limit what we eat and drink make news constantly.

You can read all about the folly of trying to build cities in a desert.\\n\\nJust this week, economists at the University of California, Davis, estimated that water shortages will cost the state's economy $2.7 billion this year. Many farmers are limiting the economic damage by ransacking the environment instead, draining underground aquifers.\\n\\nBut let your mind wander a bit. Think about Australia.

       "6   When it comes to the crop insurance sweepstakes, southwest Minnesota farmer Darwyn Bach is a winner. But he concedes that his good fortune presents a quandary, since the way the program is implemented these days creates significant losers: the soil, beginning farmers and Main Street businesses that suffer when the number of families in a rural community decline. “Because of crop insurance, there really is less risk for me in grain farming right now,” Bach told me recently. “But long term for our community, it’s definitely not good.”\\n\\nBach’s concern is shared by many across the Corn Belt. A program that started out simply as a way for farmers to ride out the droughts, floods, pest infestations and other curve balls nature tosses their way has quietly transformed into one of the biggest drivers of how crop farming is carried out in this country. And as discussion over the next Farm Bill heats up—the Senate Ag Committee is hinting we may have a new bill yet this spring—it’s become clear that commodity grou...  \n",
       "7   The U.S. Department of Agriculture got into a little trouble this week when an interoffice newsletter encouraged USDA employees to participate in the growing nationwide practice of observing “Meatless Mondays,” i.e, abstaining from meat one day a week to promote personal health and the health of the planet. Within just a day or two, strenuous objections from the cattle industry and from Iowa Congressman Steve King led to a hasty retraction by the agency:\\n\\n“U.S.D.A. does not endorse Meatless Monday,” a spokeswoman said in a statement. The newsletter, which covered topics like the installation of energy-efficient lights on the Ag Promenade and recycling goals, “was posted without proper clearance,” the statement said.\\n\\nThat incident illustrates why I’m not terribly optimistic, to say the least, about the success of a petition recently initiated by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) seeking to remove all milk (not just the always-controversial flavored milk) from the National School...  \n",

In fact, a Yale University Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity study found that a majority of Americans understand that soda is bad for them. But despite this, a Gallup poll reveals that 48 percent of surveyed Americans -- nearly half! -- drink soda on a daily basis. What's more, among those who drank soda, the average daily intake was 2.6 glasses per day.\\n\\nRates of soda consumption were higher with young adults -- 56 percent of those 18 to 34 admitted to guzzling the sweet stuff. And that shouldn't come as a total surprise: we already know that soda is the largest source of sugar in the diet of children and adolescents.\\n\\nOf note, though soda consumption is linked to obesity, there was no difference in the self-reported weights of those who drank soda daily and those who did not, reported MSNBC. In both groups, an average 40 percent reported being somewhat or very overweight. The rese...  \n",

According to the series of reports from BMJ (formerly British Medical Journal), the makers of drinks like Gatorade and Powerade have spent millions in research and marketing in recent decades to persuade sports and medical professionals, not to mention the rest of us suckers, that a primal instinct—the sensation of thirst—is an unreliable guide for deciding when to drink.

When it comes to avoiding a 2°C rise, \"impossible\" is translated into \"difficult but doable\", whereas \"urgent and radical\" emerge as \"challenging\" - all to appease the god of economics (or, more precisely, finance). For example, to avoid exceeding the maximum rate of emission reduction dictated by economists, \"impossibly\" early peaks in emissions are assumed, together with naive notions about \"big\" engineering and the deployment rates of low-carbon infrastructure. More disturbingly, as emissions budgets dwindle, so geoengineering is increasingly proposed to ensure that the diktat of economists remains unquestioned.\\n\\nIs our relentless quest for economic growth killing the planet?

       "18  Listen to MP3 podcast\\n\\nWhere did the record cattle prices this year come from? That is a question almost all analysts and many cattle producers are asking. It was not so surprising to have record high cattle prices, but the real surprise was the lofty heights of those new records. In the first quarter, as an example, Nebraska steers averaged $147 per live hundredweight which was more than $20 higher than the previous first quarter record price. In percentage terms, finished cattle prices in the first quarter this year were up 17 percent and production was down only four percent.\\n\\nIt is easy to list some possible causes, but none of them seem to be large enough to have caused such startlingly high prices. We start with the fact that meat and poultry supplies all were low. We have mentioned the four percent reduced beef production and broiler egg hatchability has been low, reducing chicken supplies below expectations. Then it appears that PED virus in hogs may have been the real kicker, primarily becaus...  \n",
